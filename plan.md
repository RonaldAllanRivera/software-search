# Compare Functionality Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to add a compare feature to the plugin's list view, enabling users to select up to 3 items for side-by-side comparison using a responsive popup. All UI logic will use vanilla JavaScript to ensure compatibility and avoid conflicts with Elementor.

## Features & Requirements
- Add a new column with compare checkboxes to the list view table.
- Add a COMPARE button below the SEARCH button.
- COMPARE button is only visible when 2 or 3 checkboxes are checked.
- If more than 3 checkboxes are checked, hide the COMPARE button and show a note: "You can only compare a maximum of 3 data."
- On clicking COMPARE, display a responsive popup showing the selected items in a grid/list format.
- All JavaScript must be vanilla (no jQuery or frameworks).
- Popup must be modern, accessible, and mobile-friendly.
- Suggest and implement modern UI/UX improvements where possible.

## Implementation Steps
1. **UI Changes**
   - Add a new column to the list view table for compare checkboxes.
   - Add a COMPARE button just below the SEARCH button.

2. **JavaScript Logic**
   - Track checked checkboxes (max 3 allowed).
   - Show COMPARE button only if 2-3 checkboxes are checked.
   - Hide COMPARE button and show a note if more than 3 are checked.
   - When COMPARE is clicked, gather data for checked items and show in a popup.

3. **Popup Implementation**
   - Create a responsive, accessible popup/modal.
   - Display compared items in a grid/list layout.
   - Include a close button and allow closing by clicking outside the popup.

4. **Modern UI/UX Suggestions**
   - Use clear, large checkboxes and buttons for touch accessibility.
   - Animate popup open/close for smooth user experience.
   - Use cards or bordered boxes for each compared item in the popup.
   - Responsive grid: 1 column on mobile, 2-3 columns on desktop.
   - Add keyboard navigation support for popup.

5. **Testing & QA**
   - Test on multiple browsers and devices.
   - Ensure no conflicts with Elementor or other plugins.

## Notes
- All code should be well-commented and modular.
- Consider adding hooks/filters for future extensibility.
- Document any new functions or template changes.
